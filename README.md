# Cychat Server

  This repository contains a bash script for Ubuntu server that allows you to manage a DHCP server and an SSH server. It's main feature is to enable/disable all possible screenshots from a Windows client. This script is useful for chat desktop applications that communicate through LAN. It's my first ever project for my final year.
